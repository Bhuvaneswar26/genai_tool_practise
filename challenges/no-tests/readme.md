# Upgrade Required

## Introduction

This folder contains a Java Spring Boot application that has no unit tests! Who can believe it possible in this day and age?

The application requires you to create some unit tests.

## The Challenge

There are no tests at all so you will be starting from scratch. Create as many suitable unit tests as you think are necessary to ensure that the code is working well and that the test coverage is to a level that would be acceptable for a production application.

If you are running out of time, create as many tests as you can. You will get points for the tests that you create.

## Suggested Approach

1. Use JUnit as the testing framework for this Java Spring Boot application.
2. Identify key functionalities and edge cases in the application.
3. Write unit tests for each functionality, ensuring proper coverage.
4. Run the tests and verify that all pass successfully.
5. Refactor the code if necessary to improve .
## Points
Up to 400 points

## Mark Scheme

* 200 points - a comprehensive set of unit tests including relevant edge cases
* 200 points - you can explain to the instructor to their satisfaction that you understand why the various tests have been applied
