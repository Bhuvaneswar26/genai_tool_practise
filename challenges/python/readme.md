# Project Upgrade: Perl to Python

## Overview
This project involves upgrading the existing codebase from Perl to Python to improve maintainability, readability, and performance. Python's modern libraries and active community support make it a robust choice for future development.

## Key Changes
- Migrated all core functionalities from Perl to Python.
- Improved code structure using Python's object-oriented programming features.
- Enhanced error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Utilized Python's standard libraries and third-party modules for better performance.

## Benefits of the Upgrade
- **Readability**: Python's syntax is cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Maintainability**: The upgraded codebase is modular and easier to extend.
- **Performance**: Leveraged Python's optimized libraries for faster execution.
- **Community Support**: Python's active community ensures long-term support.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Testing
- Unit tests have been added to validate the functionality.
- Run tests using:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## Future Improvements
- Add more test coverage.
- Optimize specific modules for better performance.
- Explore opportunities to integrate Python-based frameworks.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the team for their efforts in making this upgrade successful.
