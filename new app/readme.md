# Expense Tracker Application

This application is designed to help users track their expenses, categorize them, and view analytics to better manage their finances.

## Features
1. Add, edit, and delete expenses.
2. Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).
3. View analytics such as total expenses, category-wise breakdown, and monthly trends.
4. Responsive website for seamless usage across devices.
5. REST API for backend functionality.

## Technologies
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Unit Testing: Jest (for backend) and React Testing Library (for frontend)

## Minimum Requirements
1. Core functionality: Expense tracking and analytics.
2. Responsive user interface.
3. Database for persisting expense data.
4. Unit tests for frontend and backend.
5. Deployment plan with basic security considerations.

## Testing
- Unit tests for backend APIs using Jest.
- Component and integration tests for frontend using React Testing Library.
- End-to-end tests using Cypress to ensure seamless user experience.
- Mocking and stubbing for external dependencies during testing.

## Performance Improvements
- Optimize database queries to reduce latency.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- Minify and bundle frontend assets for faster load times.
- Use lazy loading for images and large components.
- Monitor performance using tools like Lighthouse and New Relic.

## Bug Prevention Strategies
- Use TypeScript for type safety in both frontend and backend.
- Implement comprehensive input validation to prevent invalid data.
- Write thorough unit and integration tests to catch bugs early.
- Use linters (e.g., ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Prettier) for consistent code quality.
- Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential issues.

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the database using provided scripts.
4. Run the application locally using `npm start`.
5. Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).

## Security Considerations
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Store sensitive data securely (e.g., hashed passwords).

## Mark Scheme
Your instructors will be looking for:
- A well-written README file that explains the application and how to run it.
- A relevant and useful application.
- A good set of unit tests.
- Consideration of deployment, observability, and security.
- A good understanding of the code and how it works.

## Points
Your application can score up to 1000 points!
