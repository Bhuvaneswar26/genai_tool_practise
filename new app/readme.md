# Final Challenge

In this final challenge, you have been tasked with creating an application from scratch!

This application should be finance related.

## Technologies

You may use any technology you like that is used within the firm.

Your application can be data related or web based or a back end of some kind, or a simple mix of all three, or something completely different!

If you require data for your application, you can use the Gen AI tools to generate some data for you.

## Minimum Requirements

To ensure clarity, your application should meet the following minimum requirements:
1. Implement at least one core finance-related functionality (e.g., expense tracking, budget analysis, or investment forecasting).
2. Include a user interface if applicable, or provide clear API endpoints for backend applications.
3. Use a database or data storage mechanism to persist data if necessary.
4. Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the application.
5. Provide a deployment plan and address basic security considerations.

## Mark Scheme
Your instructors will be looking for the following:
- A well-written README file that explains the application and how to run it
- A relevant and useful application
- A good set of unit tests
- Some consideration of deployment, observability, and security
- A good understanding of the code and how it works
- A good understanding of the Gen AI tools used

## Points
Your application can score up to 1000 points!
